## Features

This repository is to open-source the library that's used in my [Unity Android Bluetooth Low Energy](https://github.com/Velorexe/Unity-Android-Bluetooth-Low-Energy) plugin under the `Assets/Plugins/Android/unityandroidble.jar`. To not make everything secret or closed-sourced, this repository contains the Java side of things, for transparency sake, but also for people who want to expand on the project and add other custom commands.

## Compiling

Compiling the application to a `.jar` is simple. There's a Gradle task called `createJar` which builds the application for you, moves the jar to the `app/libs` directory and renames it to `unityandroidble.jar`.
